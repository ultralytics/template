    Test the add_numbers function from module1 by verifying the correctness of summation operation between pairs of
    integers.

    Tests:
      - Ensures that the sum of 2 and 3 equals 5.
      - Validates that the sum of -1 and 1 equals 0.

    Returns:
      (None): This function performs assertions to validate the behavior of add_numbers. It does not return a value.

    Raises:
      AssertionError: If any of the assertions fail, this error is raised indicating a test case failure.
