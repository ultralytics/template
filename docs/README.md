# Documentation Directory (`docs/`)

This directory contains the documentation for our project, managed with MkDocs.

## Overview

- **MkDocs Configuration:** The configuration file for MkDocs is `mkdocs.yml`. It defines the structure and settings of our project documentation.
- **Documentation Files:** Written in Markdown, these files reside in this directory and are structured according to the MkDocs configuration.

## Getting Started

To work with the documentation:

1. **Install MkDocs:** Ensure MkDocs is installed in your environment.
2. **Preview Documentation:** Run `mkdocs serve` to start a local server and preview the documentation in your browser.
3. **Build Documentation:** Use `mkdocs build` to generate the static site.

The documentation should be kept up-to-date with the project's development, ensuring clarity and usefulness for both internal developers and external users.
