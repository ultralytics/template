# Documentation Directory (`docs/`)

This directory contains the documentation for the [Ultralytics](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) project, built and managed using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/).

## ðŸ“– Overview

- **MkDocs Configuration:** The primary configuration file for MkDocs is `mkdocs.yml`. This file defines the structure, navigation, and settings of our project documentation. You can learn more about [MkDocs configuration options](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/configuration/).
- **Documentation Files:** All documentation content is written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/), a lightweight markup language. These files reside within this `docs/` directory and are organized according to the structure defined in `mkdocs.yml`.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To work with the documentation locally:

1.  **Install MkDocs:** Ensure MkDocs and its necessary extensions are installed in your Python environment. Follow the [MkDocs installation guide](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/installation/) if you haven't already.
2.  **Preview Documentation:** Navigate to the root directory of this repository in your terminal and run the command `mkdocs serve`. This starts a local development server, allowing you to preview the documentation site in your web browser, typically at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`. The site will automatically reload when you save changes to the documentation files or the configuration.
3.  **Build Documentation:** To generate the static HTML site (usually for deployment), use the `mkdocs build` command. This creates a `site/` directory containing the built documentation. For more details on commands, see the [MkDocs CLI documentation](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/cli/).

The documentation should be continuously updated alongside the project's development to maintain clarity, accuracy, and usefulness for both internal developers and external users exploring the [Ultralytics Docs](https://docs.ultralytics.com/).
