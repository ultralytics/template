# Source Code Directory (`src/` or `your_package_name/`)

The root directory of this project serves as the container for the Python source code.

## Structure

- Our project is organized directly at the root level into modules and sub-packages.
- Each sub-package or module resides in its own dedicated folder or file right at the root.
- The `pyproject.toml` file, also at the root of our project, defines the packaging configurations.

## Guidelines

- Ensure that code is well-documented and adheres to Ultralytics coding standards.
- Introduce new modules or packages as necessary, maintaining a logical and clean structure directly at the root level.
- All code should be rigorously tested and verified for functionality and performance, ensuring high-quality standards are upheld.
